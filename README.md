# PyOpenGL-Mini-Scripts
*short pygame + pyopengl scripts*

I'm trying to learn OpenGL basics over next few months. PyGame + PyOpenGL seems like a good way to get started.  
The goal is to write a bunch of short scripts and post them on git-hub.  My coding background is mostly Matlab.  Will
probably start by translating some matlab scripts to pyOpenGL + pygame + numpy

Overall, the plan is to start with the easiest topics and gradually work toward the really heavy stuff.  I have limited
knowledge of the scope of opengl, but the tentative steps are:

* topic 1: Basics
  * 2d scripts         
    * keyboard input
    * mouse input  
  * 3d scripts
    * moving camera
    * moving objects
  * surfaces
  * lighting
  * sub-plots
  * review: write ~300 line script, maybe spaceship + euler planets

* topic 2:  
  * Matrices
  * Stacks

* topic 3:  other opengl
  * three.js
  * c++

### break-out game (no upper blocks)

The purpose of this script was to: 
* get started with pyGame windows 
* get started with pyOpenGL
* refresh memory on python loops/if statements 
* post something on git-hub

The actual program works pretty much the same as an earlier Matlab script, so this was good opportunity to focus on learning about syntax. I'll try adding the you-tube link to Matlab video to see if this works with git-hub wiki.
