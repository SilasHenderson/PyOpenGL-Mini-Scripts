# PyOpenGL-Mini-Scripts
*short pygame + pyopengl scripts*

I'm trying to learn OpenGL basics over next few months. PyGame + PyOpenGL seems like a good way to get started.  
The goal is to write a bunch of short scripts and post them on git-hub.  Will
probably start by translating some matlab scripts to pyOpenGL + pygame + numpy

Overall, the plan is to start with the easiest topics and gradually work toward the really heavy stuff. The tentative steps are:

* 2d scripts (keyboard/mouse)      
* 3d scripts (camera/objects)
* surfaces/lighting
* sub-plots/menus
* Matrices/Stacks
* unclear, c++ ?

### break-out game (no upper blocks)

The purpose of this script was to: 
* get started with pyGame windows 
* get started with pyOpenGL
* refresh memory on python loops/if statements 
* post something on git-hub

The actual program works pretty much the same as an earlier Matlab script, so this was good opportunity to focus on learning about syntax. I'll try adding the you-tube link to Matlab video to see if this works with git-hub wiki.
